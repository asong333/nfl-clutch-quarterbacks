# Who Was the Most Clutch NFL Quarterback Between 2009 and 2018?

## Project Overview

This is a personal data analysis project I created to answer the question: who was the most clutch QB in the NFL? Here is how the project was completed:

1. Data source, containing all regular season NFL plays between 2009 and 2018, was downloaded from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maxhorowitz/nflplaybyplay2009to2016
2. Data (CSV file) was imported into **PostgreSQL** table
3. PostgreSQL queries were written using **DBeaver**
4. Queried data sets were exported to CSV and imported into **PowerBI**
5. PowerBI visuals were created
6. Comprehensive report was written including project details, takeaways, and data visualizations
