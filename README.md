## Project Overview

This is a personal data analysis project I created to answer the question: who was the most clutch QB in the NFL? Here is how the project was completed:

1. Data source, containing all regular season NFL plays between 2009 and 2018, was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maxhorowitz/nflplaybyplay2009to2016)
2. Data (CSV file) was imported into **PostgreSQL** table
3. PostgreSQL [queries](query_nfl_plays.sql) were written using **DBeaver**
4. Queried data sets were exported to CSV and imported into **PowerBI**
5. PowerBI visuals were created - [PowerBI file](nfl_viz.pbix)
6. Comprehensive report was written including project details, takeaways, and data visualizations

The final report can be found here: [Final Report](nfl_clutch_qb_report.pdf)
